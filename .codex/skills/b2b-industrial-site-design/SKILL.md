description: Use when designing or refactoring manufacturing, optical, industrial equipment, or enterprise B2B websites that must feel credible, restrained, and non-generic. Prefer full-width sections, low-radius controls, disciplined typography, and information-first layouts over card-heavy, playful, or "AI-generated" styling.

# B2B Industrial Site Design

Apply this skill for corporate product sites where trust, precision, and technical credibility matter more than novelty.

## Core rules

1. Prefer structure over decoration.
- Use full-width sections with inner containers.
- Use borders, spacing, and background tone shifts to separate content.
- Do not default to floating cards for major layout blocks.
- Align subpage hero copy with the effective start line of body content. Do not leave hero copy glued to the viewport edge or visibly offset from the page body rhythm.

2. Keep shape language restrained.
- Buttons: 8px to 12px radius.
- Panels: 0px to 12px radius unless there is a clear visual reason.
- Avoid pill buttons unless the brand already uses them.

3. Design for credibility.
- Typography should feel engineered, not playful.
- Use strong hierarchy, moderate weight contrast, and tight spacing control.
- Avoid marketing fluff, product-irrelevant slogans, and UI meta copy.

4. Use color conservatively.
- Base palette: white, blue, gray, steel tones.
- Avoid loud gradients, glowing accents, and decorative blobs unless they express product technology directly.
- Interactive blue should feel corporate, not candy-like.

5. Header and footer must be architectural.
- Full-width bars.
- Clean navigation rhythm.
- Dropdowns should read as information layers, not toy popovers.
- Footer should feel like a company information band, not a floating widget.
- Top-nav hover indicators should sit on the header baseline, not float under the text.
- If CSS hover keeps dropdowns open after client-side navigation, add a click-to-suppress pattern until the pointer leaves the nav region.

6. Product and application pages should read like solution pages.
- Use page headers, index anchors, technical summaries, and vertical content flow.
- Prefer image/diagram zones plus concise bullet points.
- Keep content density professional.
- Mirror the site map in navigation depth. If a section has meaningful child pages, expose them as 2depth items instead of hiding them in body content only.

7. Avoid obvious AI-site signals.
- Do not stack multiple oversized rounded boxes.
- Do not overuse glassmorphism, soft shadows, gradients, or generic feature chips.
- Do not put implementation metadata on customer-facing pages.
- Remove customer-visible text that explains CMS, SEO, DB, SMTP, deployment, or admin capabilities unless the page is explicitly for operators.
- Preserve brand assets. If the provided logo is raster-only, keep it for site branding and create separate OG/social compositions around it rather than redrawing the logo arbitrarily.

## Working method

1. Audit current UI for trust-breaking patterns.
2. Flatten the layout first: sections, bars, spacing, borders.
3. Reduce radius and decorative effects globally.
4. Rewrite hero and navigation to be product-first.
5. Check desktop, tablet, and mobile separately.
6. Verify hover, click-through, and submenu dismissal behaviors after navigation.

## Output contract

When applying this skill, always state:
- Which components were flattened or de-carded.
- Radius and visual-language decisions.
- Remaining places that still look too soft, playful, or generic.
